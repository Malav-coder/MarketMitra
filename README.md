## Getting Started ▶️

To set up and run this project, please refer to the [Setup and Installation Guide](SETUP.md).

## Development Notes 📝

For specific instructions and conventions related to developing with the Gemini CLI agent, please refer to [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md).

1.  **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
2.  **Register**: Click on the "Register" tab. Fill in your details, including a valid Indian phone number (starting with 6, 7, 8, or 9 and 10 digits long). Select your preferred verification method (Email or Phone).
3.  **Verify OTP**: After registration, you will be redirected to an OTP verification page. Enter the OTP received via email or phone.
4.  **Login**: Once verified, you can log in using your registered email and password.

## Scrapers 🕷️

This project includes a Python-based web scraper located in the `scraper` directory:

-   **IPO Data Scraper (`ipo_data_scraper.py`)**: This scraper fetches IPO data and stores it in the MongoDB database. It is intended to be run periodically to keep the IPO data up-to-date.

### Running the Scrapers 🏃

To run the scraper, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the `scraper` directory**:

    ```bash
    cd scraper
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended to avoid conflicts with other projects):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the `scraper` directory and add the following variables:

    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```

5.  **Run the IPO data scraper**:

    ```bash
    python ipo_data_scraper.py
    ```

## Django API Backend 🐍

The financial data and news sentiment analysis APIs are now served by a dedicated Django backend. This backend includes an interactive home page that allows you to test the API endpoints directly from your browser. For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to the [Django API Backend README](api/README.md).
